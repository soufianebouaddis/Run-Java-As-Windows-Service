# Quartz Scheduler as a Windows Service

This project showcases how to run a Java application as a Windows service using **WinSW** (Windows Service Wrapper). With this setup, you can ensure that your Quartz Scheduler application runs in the background, automatically starting with the system and providing logging for monitoring.

## Features

- **Run Java Applications as Windows Services**: Leverage WinSW to create a robust Windows service for your Java applications.
- **Quartz Scheduler Integration**: Schedule and execute jobs seamlessly with Quartz, providing powerful scheduling capabilities.
- **Logging**: Built-in logging using SLF4J and Logback to keep track of service activities and job executions.
